## 3. Get Your Maptiler API Key
The map view uses Maptiler tiles. You need a free API key to use them.

Go to the Maptiler Cloud website and create a free account.(https://cloud.maptiler.com)

On the "Keys" page, find your default API key.(https://cloud.maptiler.com/account/keys/)

Copy this key and paste it into the lib/screens/nearby_screen.dart file on line 205, replacing MAP-API-KEY-HERE.

4. Run the App
Connect a physical device or start an emulator and run the app:

flutter run

This will launch the application on your device, and you can start exploring the food reels and nearby spots.
